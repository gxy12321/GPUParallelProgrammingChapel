GPU Parallel Programming using Chapel

  Notes for the workshop: https://wgpages.netlify.app/chapel-gpu/#distributed-a_on_host-array
  
  In this workshop, the following things are learned:
  
    1. Syntax of Chapel
    2. GPU diagnostics
    3. Verifying if a loop can run on a GPU
    4. Timing on the CPU/GPU
    5. Finer control
    6. Multiple locales and multiple GPUs
    7. Running multi-GPU code on Cedar
    8. Distributed A_on_host array
    9. Adding plotting to run on a GPU
    10. Reduction operations 

  Practice with the following projects:

    1. Prime factorization of each element of a large array, see: primeGPUTimer.chpl
    2. Julia set problem, see: juliaSerialGPU.chpl
